# Homogeneously Charged Ellipsoids – Physics Cup '25 Problem 1

I will give two solutions, one that uses the typical olympiad-like methods of clever superpositions, and the second which makes use of Legendre polynomials and is perhaps more textbook-like.

### Clever Superpositions
Here is a layout of the proof:
1. Electric field inside a homogeneously charged ellipsoidal shell is 0
2. The electric potential is homogeneous of degree -2 (i.e. $\\varphi(kx,ky,kz)=k^{-2} \\varphi(x,y,z)$)
3. Homogeneously polarized ellipsoid gives a homogeneous electric field inside it

### Solution using Legendre Polynomials

The force between the two spheres arises as follows: In the rotating spheres, charges redistribute due to the Lorentz force. The resulting charge distribution causes an electric field that is characterisitc of quadrupoles. Although weak, this electric field induces surface charges on the second sphere, giving it a dipole moment. Because the electric field in which the dipole/sphere is situated is not homogeneous, the dipole will experience a slight force. Magnetization was not accounted for, because in the problem it was assumed that $\\mu=1$.

**Force acting on second sphere**
The hardest part is determining the electric field produced by the rotating sphere. So, let's first build the foundation for everything else. 

Let us assume for a bit that the created field IS homogeneous and is equal to $\\mathbf{E_0}$. In that case, a metal sphere would compensate for this electirc field (to achieve $\\mathbf{E}=\\mathbf{0}$ inside itself) using some surface charges $\\sigma(\\theta)$. We can model this situation using two spheres with equal and opposite charge densities $\\pm \\rho$. If they are superposed onto each other with a slight displacement $\\mathbf{d}$, then we effectively have 0 charge density inside them along with a uniform electric field $\\frac{\\rho \\mathbf{d}}{3\\varepsilon_0}$. Let us pick $\\rho$ and $\\mathbf{d}$ in a way that the ambient electric field is cancelled out as $\\frac{\\rho \\mathbf{d}}{3\\varepsilon_0}=-\\mathbf{E_0}$. The only places where there are any remnants of charge, are the upper and lower surfaces of the sphere. 

This kind of modelling is allowed because after superposing it with the ambient electric field, it gives an electric field identical to that of the metal sphere (zero inside it, discontinuous at the surface). Thanks to this analogy, it is clear that the dipole moment of the metal sphere is $$\\mathbf{p}=-\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 \\rho \\mathbf{d}=4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 \\mathbf{E_0}.$$

As for the force, we can no longer ignore the electric field's inhomogeneity. Luckily, we are only interested in the radial direction since everything else cancels out by symmetry.
$$\\mathbf{F_r}=\\left[(\\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\nabla ) \\mathbf{E} \\right]_r$$

$$
    \\mathbf{E_0}=\\mathbf{p} \\frac{\\partial E_0}{\\partial r}. \\quad (1)
$$
**Rotating sphere**
In the sphere, the Lorentz force acting on a charge is zero, and we will see why. Let us go into an inertial frame of reference that is instantaneously moving along with some point in the sphere. In this frame, there is no current density at that point, meaning that $$ 0=\\sigma \\mathbf{E^*}=\\gamma \\sigma(\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{v}\\times \\mathbf{B})$$ where the starred terms refer to the comoving f.o.r. Thus, in the lab frame the electric field is 
$$\\mathbf{E}=-\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}$$ and it is caused by both the charge density $\\rho$ inside the sphere and a surface charge, which add up to 0 as the sphere is neutral.

What can be concluded from the equation is that the electric field always points away from the axis of symmetry as
$$\\mathbf{E}=-\\omega B \\mathbf{ \\rho}$$ where $\\rho$ is the distance from the axis.  It is noteworthy that the charge density is uniform and from Gauss's law
$$\\rho = -2 \\varepsilon_0 \\omega B.$$
 The total charge is kept 0 by the surface charge, which has a very unique distribution.

In the steady state, there can't be any current inside the sphere, because with no electromotive force (since a line integral of $\\mathbf{E}$ gives 0, emf is also 0), the Ohmic losses will kill out any current. The only case in which we expect to see currents, is when the magnetic field is time-dependent P Lorrain. Electrostatic charges in v*b fields: the faraday disk and the

Instead, all of the charges are rotating along with the sphere as a rigid body. 
Outside the sphere, thanks to azimuthal symmetry, we can search for the potential using Legendre polynomials $P_l$. The general solution utilizing them is
$$
V(r, \\theta)=\\sum_{l=0}^{\\infty}\\left(A_l r^l+\\frac{B_l}{r^{l+1}}\\right) P_l(\\cos \\theta)
$$
The potential must go to 0 at infinity, so we know that $A_l=0$ for any l. Now, we can write out the potential as
$$
V(r, \\theta)=\\frac{B_0}{r}+\\frac{B_1}{r^2} \\cos \\theta+\\frac{B_2}{r^3} \\frac{3 \\cos ^2 \\theta-1}{2}+\\cdots
$$
For the region inside the sphere, we can find the potentials using the previously calculated electric field $\\mathbf{E}=-\\omega B \\mathbf{\\rho}$ to obtain
$$
    V(r=R)=V_0+\\omega B R^2 \\sin ^2 \\theta / 2 \\quad (2)
$$
 on the surface of the sphere. As it turns out, the sphere is symmetric about its equatorial plane, as also seen on figure 1. 

Comparing the two results, we can see that all terms in the polynomial with higher orders than $\\cos ^2 \\theta$ must be irrelevant to us.
We also know that the sphere as a whole is uncharged, so the first term, which is characteristic of a point charge, is also irrelevant. Lastly, we can eliminate the 2nd term as this is characteristic of dipoles, but thanks to the symmetry about the equatorial plane, our sphere has no dipole moment. 
All that is left is the quadrupole term
$$
V(r, \\theta)=\\frac{B_2}{r^3} \\frac{3 \\cos ^2 \\theta-1}{2}.
$$
In here, $B_2$ can be found by matching the potential to what we expected to see at the surface in eq (2). 
$$B_2=-\\frac{\\omega B R^5}{3}, \\ \\ \\ \\ V_0=-\\frac{\\omega B R^2}{3}$$
Therefore, the potential outside the sphere is 
$$ V = \\frac{\\omega B R^5}{3 r^3}\\left( \\frac{3}{2}\\sin^2 \\theta -1 \\right)$$
This can be used to find the electric field at the second sphere:
$$
    E_0(\\theta=0, r=L)=-\\frac{\\omega B R^5}{L^4}. \\quad (3)
$$
**Final steps**
All that is left to do is to take the derivative over L of the electric field in eq (3), and to plug the result into eq (1), which gives us
$$F_r=\\frac{16 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 \\omega^2 B^2 R^{13}}{L^9}.
$$

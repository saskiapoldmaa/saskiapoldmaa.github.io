# Dielectric Sphere in Uniform Electric Field (& How This Could Possibly Be a Thermodynamics Problem)

So first of all, let's get the analogy straight. or current lines will emanate and terminate at the plates. All the sphere does is just bend these lines.

Our boundary conditions are $T=T_1$ across the surface of one plate, $T=T2$ across the second plate, and $J_{\\parallel}=0$ (since this current is 0 inside the plate, and $J_{\\parallel}$ is continuous over the boundary) right next to the plate. 

Similarly, for a capacitor with plates at voltages $V_1$ and $V_2$, we would have $V=V_1$ for the lower plate and $V=V_2$ for the upper plate. Also, since $\\frac{\\partial E_{\\parallel}}{\\partial z}=0$ at the boundary, $E_{\\parallel}=0$ just next to the plate.

These boundary conditions match up, so one would be tempted to construct an analogy between heat flow and the electric field. But not so soon! Between the plates, we have $\\nabla\\cdot J=0$, yet $\\nabla \\cdot E \\neq 0$. Instead, we should use D since $\\nabla\\cdot D=\\rho_f=0$ and the same boundary conditions apply for D. 

To use this analogy, we must configure the constants using the analogy of the Poisson equation. If instead of T we have V, then instead of $\\nabla  \\cdot D=-\\varepsilon \\varepsilon_0 \\Delta V$ and $\\nabla \\cdot J=K\\Delta T$. So to convert $D$ to $J$, we must multiply it by $\\frac{\\kappa \\Delta T}{\\varepsilon \\varepsilon_0 \\Delta V}$.

Initially, when $\\kappa$ is very small, the heat flux throught the sphere will be negligible, meaning the field lines will curve around the sphere. This corresponds to $\\varepsilon_1 \\ll varepsilon$$ (b) and $\\varepsilon_2 \\gg \\varepsilon_1$ (a).

The fields are just a superposition of a uniform electric field $E_0=\\frac{V_1-V_2}{L}$ and that of two oppositely charged ($+\\rho/-\\rho$) spheres, displaced wrt each other by an infitesimal distance 

Applying the boundary condition of $D_n=const.$ to the point, where the field line will enter the dielectric parallel to the surface normal. 

$$\\varepsilon\\left( E_0+\\frac{2 \\rho d}{3 \\varepsilon_0}\\right)=\\varepsilon\\left( E_0-\\frac{\\rho d}{3 \\varepsilon_0}\\right)$

from which 

$$P=\\rho d=3 \\varepsilon_0 \\frac{\\varepsilon - \\varepsilon_1}{\\varepsilon + \\varepsilon_1}$$

To find the heat flux, we must find $\\int_{plate} D\\cdot dS=\\langle D\\rangle S=\\varepsilon_0 \\langle E \\rangle S+ \\langle P\\rangle S$$

where the averaging is done over the surface of the plate. To find the change in flux, we are not actually concerned with $\\rangle E\\langle$ since this will be the same for both scenarios.

Instead, 

$$\\Delta \\Phi = $$

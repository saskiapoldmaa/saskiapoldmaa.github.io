# Sphere Wandering Around in Vacuum

The sphere receives a certain amount of ambient radiation, while also emitting the same amount (averaged over a long period). 

Both the absorbed and emitted photons will have, on average, energy $2.7 kT$, and hence momentum $2.7 kT/c$.

The sphere itself has speed v, which corresponds to the average rms velocity of a Brownian particle at temperature T

$$ v=\\sqrt{\\frac{3kT}{m}}$$

thus $p=\\sqrt{3mkT}$.

On average, a photon is emitted in time intervals

$$ \\frac{2.7 kT}{4\\pi \\sigma R^2 T^4} $$

and a photon will be either emitted/absorbed at intervals

$$ \\tau= \\frac{2.7 kT}{2\\pi \\sigma R^2 T^4}. $$

The momentum vector will be doing a random walk with step size $2.7 kT/c$ in intervals $\\tau$. I.e. our random walker is moving around in the $p_x, p_y, p_z$ space.

The number of emissions/absorptions needed for the momentum vector to move by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ (since the momentum vector must rotate by $\\pi/2$) is  $\\frac{2p^2c^2}{(2.7 kT)^2}=\\frac{6mc^2}{2.7^2 kT}$.

The time needed to do these steps is 

$$t=\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{6m}c}{2.7^2 \\sqrt{kT}}\\right)^2 \\tau=\\frac{3mc^2}{2.7^2 \\pi \\sigma R^2 T^4}.$$
 
The mean free path length, as defined in the problem statement, is just the distance that the sphere travels in the time t

$$\\lambda=\\frac{3^{3/2}\\sqrt{mk}c^2}{\\pi\\sigma R^2 T^{7/2}}$$

# The Challenge

This is my attempt to keep myself accountable in my studies through posting about it.

I have challenged myself to solve all of the 50-something [Physics Cup](https://physicscup.ee/) in the upcoming months. I decided to give myself on average 2 days per problem, so the deadline is set in stone fot May 31, 2025. 

I will keep this page up no matter how well this challenge goes for me. 

Below, you cna find all of the solutions I have already completed.

[Seagull 2025](../articles/kajakas25.md). Completed February 10.

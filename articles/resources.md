# Resoruces I wish I had known

- [VISTAR!](https://op-webtools.web.cern.ch/vistar/) Not extremely useful, but just very cool (imo). Allows you to see the real-time view of different experiments at CERN (everything from the T10 beamline to ATLAS). The same views are also displayed on TVs everywhere around the CERN campus.

- [Sci-Hub](https://www.sci-hub.ru/) Slightly illegal, but you gotta do what you gotta do. For high-schoolers, this is truly the only way to access scientific content –– well ArXiv exists but its reach is quite limited. All you need is the doi number of the article.
- [Op-Webtools](https://op-webtools.web.cern.ch/) A collection of cool pages. MY favorites include Vistar and Online Logbook (I'm afraid the ladder is locked behind institutional barriers, though).
- [Particle Data Group](https://pdg.lbl.gov/index.html) The bible of particle physics. This is the place you should run to, to get your data.
- [BL4S list of detectors](https://beamline-for-schools.web.cern.ch/sites/default/files/Beams_Detectors__BL4S2025.pdf) Gives you an overview of what detectors are available.
- [Indico](https://indico.cern.ch/) CERN's website for events/conferences/webinars. Even as a bystander, it is sometimes useful to look throught the event proceedings, as different summer schools/workshops often upload educational content.
- [DIY Cherenkov detector](https://physicsopenlab.org/2016/04/24/diy-cherenkov-detector/) I think it's feasible to construct one. PMTs and oscilloscopes can be accessed by just writing a sweet and businesslike email to you local university.

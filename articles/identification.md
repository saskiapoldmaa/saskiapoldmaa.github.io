What particles are in the beam?
===============================

Well, there are lots of beams on offer at CERN. You just pick one out from a catalogue, place your order on the computer by selecting the right beamfile, and to place the order, you call to the CCC (CERN Control Centre).

We worked with positive hadron beams â€“ that means the beam is composed of protons, pions, the alike.
Whenever we wanted only muons, we would order for a beamstopper to be put in the beam. The beamstopper is a massive metal block, which stops the particles, and muons are the only decayproducts that can actually penetrate it.

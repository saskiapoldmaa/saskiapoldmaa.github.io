Feynman Diagrams
================

Feynman diagrams are an incredible tool for visualizing interactions in quantum field theory. Whether you’re a beginner or looking for a rigorous understanding, there’s a level of explanation here for you!

### Quick Overview

Here's the quickest explanation:

*   The pitfall I encountered was not knowing that the picture doesn't depict the x-y plane. Instead, it's dimensions are distance and time. Usually (ca. 70% of the time), distance is shown on the horizontal axis, and time on the vertical axis.
*   Now that we've got this down – the diagrams themselves represent interactions through lines and vertices.
*   Straight lines are fermions (like electrons), wavy or dashed lines are bosons (like photons or gluons). Vertices represent interctions.
*   The arrows technically show the flow of the fermion number, but as a rule of thumb, the arrows point forward in time for regular matter, and backward in time for antimatter.
    

So, on the picture above, an electron and a positron approach each other. At some point in time, a fermion is exchanged between them. This particle is not actually observable, but it acts as a mediator, leading to an annihilation of the electron-positron pair, leaving behind only two photons.

### Let's dig a bit deeper

The second pitfall I encountered, are loops.

You'd be right to think that this is the scattering of two electrons, where they also exchange a photon. But what happens with the photon midway?

The loop shows that while the photon travels between the two electrons, it briefly splits into a virtual electron-positron pair. Yes, _virtual_ is the correct term to use. The electron and positron cannot actually be seen or measured, but they still slightly affect the interaction. Hence, the loop is there to simply fine-tune the interaction.

Oftentimes, you will encounter parallel lines in Feynman diagrams. This is used in the case of non-fundamental particles, where the dynamics of the quarks may (or may not) become important.

Kaon Decay (here, time is on the horizontal axis).

A surprising quality of Feynman diagrams is that they can be used to represent multiple interactions. Let's assume that you've just drawn how a neutrino scatters with a muon. By rotating this graph, you will arrive at another, much more common interaction – the muon decay.

The twisting of Feynman diagrams is allowed due to a property called crossing symmetry.

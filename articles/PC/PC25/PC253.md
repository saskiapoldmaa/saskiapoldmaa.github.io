# Physics Cup 2025 Poblem 3

The change in kinetic enegy of a single molecule with x-directional velocity w and mass m is
$$ \\Delta K_+=2mu(u+w) $$ when the vessel is contracting, and
$$ \\Delta K_- = 2mu(u-w)$$ when the vessel is expanding.



The number of molecules in the vessel with x-directional velocities $[w, w+\\,dw]$ is
$$dN=N\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{2\\pi k T}} \exp{-\\frac{mw^2}{2kT}}\\,dw$$.

Out of these dN molecules, only a fraction are close enough to the piston to collide with it during a single cycle.

The number of such molecules will be

$$
dn_+=
\\begin{cases}
    \left(\\frac{w}{u}+1\right) \\frac{a}{H}\\,dN, \\quad w\geq-u \\\\
    0, \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad w<-u
\\end{cases}
$$
fo the contracting vessel, and 
$$
dn_-=
\\begin{cases}
    \left(\\frac{w}{u}-1\right) \\frac{a}{H}\\,dN, \\quad w\geq u \\\\
    0, \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad w<u
\\end{cases}
$$
for the expanding vessel. 

The change in kinetic energy contributed by molecules between velocities $[w, w+\\,dw]$ over one cycle will then be 
$$
\\Delta K_+ \\,dn_++\\Delta K_- \\,dn_-=\\begin{cases}
    8mwu\\frac{a}{H}\\,dN, \\quad \\quad \\quad w>u \\\\
    2m(w+u)^2\\frac{a}{H}\\,dN, \\quad u \geq w \geq -u \\\\
    0,\\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad w<-u
\\end{cases}
$$
The first region will contribute 
$$\\frac{8uaNkT}{H}\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{2 \\pi kT}}\exp \left( -\\frac{m u^2}{2kT} \right)\approx \\frac{8uaN}{H}\\sqrt{\\frac{mkT}{2 \\pi}}$$. 

The second region will also be a contributing factor but the expression for this is quite nasty. Fortunately, it includes the $\\frac{u}{\\sqrt{kT}}$ only in orders higher than 2, and can thus be disregarded.

The temperature increases as a recursive sequence. By assuming that the temperature change over one cycle is quite small (this is truly the case, since $u \ll v$ and $a \ll H$), we can treat it as the following ODE
$$
\\frac{3}{2}kN\\,dT=\\frac{8uaN}{H}\\sqrt{\\frac{mkT}{2 \\pi}}\\frac{u\\,dt}{2a},
$$
where $u\\,dt/2a$ is the number of cycles that will be completed in time $dt$. From this, the total time, over which the temperature rises from T to $4T$, comes out to be
$$
t=\\frac{3H}{4u^2}\\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\pi kT}{m}}
$$
and after doing the final substitution of
$\\frac{kT}{m}=\\frac{v^2}{3}$, we will finally arrive at
$$
t=\\frac{\\sqrt{6\\pi}vH}{4u^2}.
$$

# The Statistics of Noise – Random Coincidence

What we consider an event (a.k.a a particle) is a signal which arrives simultaneously in multiple detectors – the scientific term for this is a coincidence event. These detectors constitute the trigger. We used a combination of two to three scintillators for the trigger. But not all events that they measured were real. 

So, the question arises, **what is the frequency of such phantom events**?

Let us take a trigger with two scintillators. Whenever light is detected by the photomultiplier that is attached to the scintillator, a signal is generated and fed into a NIM. The NIM makes these signal uniform – gives them some pre-specified height and duration.

Imagine we had such signal arriving, on average, at a frquency f.

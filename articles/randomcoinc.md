# The Statistics of Noise – Random Coincidence

What we consider an event (a.k.a a particle) is a signal which arrives simultaneously in multiple detectors – the scientific term for this is a coincidence event. These detectors constitute the trigger. We used a combination of two to three scintillators for the trigger. But not all events that they measured were real. 

So, the question arises, **what is the frequency of such phantom events**?

Let us take a trigger with two scintillators. Whenever light is detected by the photomultiplier that is attached to the scintillator, a signal is generated and fed into a NIM. The NIM makes these signal uniform – gives them some pre-specified height and duration. 

There are constantly noise  signals in either of the detectors, let this frequency be, on average, $f_1$ in the first scintillator and $f_2$ in the second scintillator. Random coincidences occur when these noise signal accidentally overlap. Let the frequency of random coincidences be $f$.

If $p$ is the probability that a signal in the first scintillator will stumble upon a signal in the 2nd scintillator, the frequncy of random coincidences will be $pf_1$.

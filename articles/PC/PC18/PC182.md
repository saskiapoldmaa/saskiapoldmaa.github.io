# Physics Cup 2018, Problem 2 – a tale about Fourier series in circuits. 

Imagine we have an infinite square-lattice of $1 \\Omega$ resistors. This problem is often solved by using symmetry to speculate about how the current will flow. However, this is slightly hand-wavy because it assumes that the potential distributes instantaneously.

Let us denote the nodes on the lattice with variables m and n. The voltage $V_{m,n}$ at each node is a superposition of the various solutions to this – a superposition because we're dealing with a linear, firs-order ODE.

One of these solutions is $$V_{m,n}(\\alpha, \\beta)=A(\\alpha, \\beta)e^{i\\abs{m}\\alpha}e^{i\\abs{n}\\beta} $$ and the total voltage is actually
$$V_{m,n}={int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi}int_{\\pi}^{\\pi} A(\\alpha, \\beta)e^{i\\abs{m}\\alpha}e^{i\\abs{n}\\beta} \\,d\\alpha \\,d\\beta$$.

The current going into a node is $I_{m,n}=4V_{m,n}-V_{m+1,n}-V_{m-1,n}-V_{m, n+1}-V_{m, n-1}$. If m and n are not 0, then the current will be 0. We will use this fact to trace down one of those equations. By selecting m and n to be $>0$ (this will help us drop the absolute signs), then we get the equation
$$2-\\cos \\alpha- \\cos \\beta=0$$.

We will get the second equation from focusing on one axis, by choosing n=0.

$$I_{m,0}(\\alpha, \\beta)=2A(\\alpha, \\beta)e^{i\\abs{m}a}(2-\\cos \\alpha-e^{i \\beta})=-2iAe^{i \\abs{m}a} \\sin \\beta $$
where we used the first relation.

$$I_{m,0}=\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi}-2iA(\\alpha, \\beta)e^{i \\abs{m}a} \\sin \\beta \\,d\\alpha $$

This is the equation for a Fourier series!

So we can get the $A(\\alpha, \\beta)$ out of there

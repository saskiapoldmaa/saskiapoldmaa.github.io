# Physics Cup 2023 Problem 5

If the lgiht sources would be emitting light in the same phase, the interference maxima would occur wherever the difference of distance to any to of the three points is an integer number of wavelengths. 

Since the light sources are actually not in phase (or at least we cannot assume they are), then the difference in distances is $ n \\lambda + \\Delta $ where $ \\Delta $ depends on the pair of light sources. Anyways, by keeping n constant, the locus of the suitable points will be a hyprbola, based on the definition of hyperbolas: "A hyperbola is a set of points, such that for any point of the set, the absolute difference of the distances to two fixed points (the foci) is constant". In this case, the foci are our light sources. By varying n, we will find multiple hyperbolas. 

Also, we can combine the 3 light sources into 3 pairs, so there are 3 sets of hyperbolas, and the points depicted in the problem statement lie at the intersections of these hyperbola.

We can find a few of these hyperbolas simply by fitting conics through 5 random points and seeing whether the resulting conic seems promising. Now, the next problem is to geometrically construct the foci of the hyperbola.

The steps for this are:
- construct the hyperbola's asymptotes using the built-in Asymptote() function
- Find the centre and vertices of the hyperbola
- Use the intersection of the tranverse axis with a circle of radius c centred on the hyperbola's centre, to find the foci. This wors because $ c= \\sqrt{a^2+b^2} $ where a and b are the semi-major/minor axes and c is the linear eccentricity.

And after finding the foci, we get a very satisfying image with various hyperbolas, all intersecting nicely at the given points.

# Conic Sections as Envelopes - Physics Cup 2025 Problem 5

When we draw tangents from point O to the ellipse, we know that these lines must also be tangents to the original circle, as these rays were not refracted since they passed through the lens's center. We also know that the angular bisector of these lines must pass through the original circle's center due to the symmetry of the tangents w.r.t. this angular bisector.

There are now four points of interest for us: the points of tangency, I and H, and the intersections of the angular bisector with the ellipse, F and G. Let us denote the points on the original circle with primes, so that $F$ would be the image of $F'$, $I$ the image of $I'$, etc. The lines connecting points F,G,H,I can now be used to construct the position of the focal plane. While the hints suggest finding a ray parallel to the lines $F'I'$ and $F'H'$, we will instead use another property.

### Key Idea 

Since $F'G'$ was the diameter of the original circle, then according to Thales' theorem, $F'I' \\perp I'G'$ and $F'H'\\perp H'G'$. If we construct parallel lines to $F'I'$\\&$I'G'$, and $F'H'$\\& $H'G'$, which pass through the lens's center, we find that these lines intersect their image lines at the focal plane (parallel lines intersect at the focal plane). Of course, the parallel lines, which we constructed, will also remain pairwise perpendicular.

Thus, if we find the focal plane, we know that its intersections with the lines $FI$\\&$IG$ and $FH$\\&$GH$ will subtend a $90^{\\circ}$ angle at the lens's center O. Now the question arises...

\\textbf{Given two lines and a point P, what is the envelope of lines that intersect the two given lines at points A and B, such that $\\mathbf{\\angle APB=90^{\\circ}}$?}

Examples of such lines are given in the figure below. It is obvious that these envelopes will be conic sections: ellipses when the point lies in the acute angle, hyperbolas when the point is in the obtuse angle, and parabolas when the two lines are orthogonal.

Let us prove that this envelope is truly a conic section. The following will use ellipses to illustrate this claim, but the same line of reasoning applies to all conic section; hence, \\textit{ellipse} and \\textit{conic section} will be used interchangeably.

Lemma 1. The tangent of a conic section will intersect the directrix such that the intersection point and the tangency point subtend a $90^{\\circ}$ angle with respect to the focus closest to the directrix.
---

Let us construct an ellipse and its directrix. Pick two random points, $E$ and $F$, on the ellipse, and find the intersection J of $EF$ with the directrix, and the projections of E and F, $G$ and $H$, onto the directrix. 

From similar triangles $JFG$ and $JEH$, we find that  
$$\\frac{JE}{JF}=\\frac{HE}{GF}=\\frac{AE/e}{AF/e}=\\frac{AE}{AF}.$$ 

This proportionality is the only property unique to conic sections, which will pave the way for the rest of the proof. The equality $\\frac{JE}{JF}=\\frac{AE}{AF}$ allows us to apply the exterior angle bisector theorem.\\footnote{Eric W. Weisstein, \\href{https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ExteriorAngleBisector.html}{\\textit{Exterior Angle Bisector}, Wolfram MathWorld}.} This theorem tells us that $\\angle JAE =\\angle JAI$, where I is the intersection of $FA$ with the ellipse. As $F\\rightarrow E$, $\\angle EAI \\rightarrow 180^{\\circ}$ and $\\angle EAJ \\rightarrow 90^{\\circ}$.

Lemma 2. The lines connecting a point and its point of tangency on a conic section, subtend equal angles at the focus. \\footnotemark{}

Select a point K at random such that it does not lie on the ellipse, and draw tangents from the point. Drop the projection of K onto the segments connecting the points of tangency to the focus closest to the point K. From $\\triangle NLK \\sim \\triangle ALQ$, we find that $AN=AL \\frac{KQ}{LQ}$, and noting that $\\triangle PQK \\sim \\triangle SQL$, $AN=AL\\frac{KP}{SL}=e \\cdot KP$.

Applying the same reasoning for the other tangent, we get $AO=e\\cdot KP=AN$. Hence, $\\triangle ANK$ and $\\triangle AKO$ are congruent, so $\\angle KAL=\\angle KAM$.

Lemma 3. A tangent from any point on a conic section intersects two given lines in such a way that the angle subtended at the focus by the intersection points remains constant, regardless of the point of tangency chosen on the conic.
---

From Lemma 2, we know that $\\angle KAO= \\angle NAO$ and $\\angle LAM = \\angle NAM$. Thus,
$$\\angle MAO = \\angle MAN+ \\angle NAO=\\frac{1}{2}(\\angle LAN + \\angle NAK)=\\frac{\\angle LAK}{2}.$$  
Since $\\angle LAK$ is constant, regardless of the point of tangency, $\\angle MAO$ is also constant.

A special case occurs when the focus $A$ lies on $KL$. Then, $\\angle LAK=180^{\\circ}$ and $\\angle MAO = 90^{\\circ}$. From Lemma 1, we also conclude that the two given lines must intersect at the directrix for this to happen. 

<img src="../articles/PC/PC25/5-5.png" width="400" height="auto">

Knowing this, we conclude that the envelope of such lines, which intersect the two given lines so that the intersection points subtend $90^{\\circ}$ (or any constant angle!) at the point P, are conic sections with P being the focus, and the intersection of the two lines lying on the directrix.

### Constructing the Lens and Focal Plane

We construct the conic section by noting that O is one of the foci, and points H and J lie on the directrix. Also, we know that for both H and J, their points of tangency must subtend $180^{\\circ}$ at O to ensure that the intersection points subtend $90^{\\circ}$ at O. Let these points of tangency be K and L for J. From Lemma 2, we know that $\\angle JOK=\\angle JOL=90^{\\circ}$. Thus, K and L can be found as the intersections of $JI$ and $FJ$ with a line passing through O, perpendicular to $JO$. 

<img src="../articles/PC/PC25/findingfocus.png" width="400" height="auto">

Having found K and L, we have now identified our first two points on the conic section, along with the tangents at those points. If conic sections were reflective surfaces, a light source at one focus would form an image at the second focus. Knowing this reflective property, we can find the second focus $P$ as the intersection of the reflections of $OK$ and $OL$ with respect to $JL$ and $JK$. 

Two foci and a point on the conic section are enough to draw the conic itself. The last step towards finding the focal plane is noting once again that $H'I'$ and $I'J'$ exhibit symmetry with respect to the angular bisector $IO$ between the tangents from O to the original circle. Therefore, $\\alpha=\\beta$ in the figure below no matter which point $N$ we choose on the conic section.

<img src="../articles/PC/PC25/findingfocal.png" width="400" height="auto">

The green lines represent $H'I'$ and $I'J'$ â€“ the images of $HI$ and $IJ$, and the dashed lines represent the possible locations of the two focal planes and lens (found as a tangent through any point $N$ on the conic). Let us also draw orange parallel lines through O to these lines. These orange lines intersect the focal plane at points B and A such that $\\angle AOB=const.$ according to Lemma 3. 

Hence, $\\alpha+\\beta=const.$. Let $HI$ be tangential to the conic at point X, and $IJ$ at Y. From Lemma 2, we know that $\\angle BON=\\frac{\\angle XON}{2}$ and $\\angle AON=\\frac{\\angle YON}{2}$. Thus, the angular bisector of $\\angle AOB$ must also be the angular bisector of $\\angle XOY$. From Lemma 2, we conclude that this angular bisector must be $OI$. \\textbf{The focal plane is a tangent of the conic at point Q, where $\\mathbf{OI}$ intersects the conic.} 


The full construction is given below and also as a [GeoGebra cosntruction](https://www.geogebra.org/classic/q8dqesya). Blue lines represent the focal plane and the lens.

                    <p>Not everything that a detector measures is actually a signal from an event that we&#39;re interested in (like a muon passing a scintillator). One way to filter out the junk is by data analysis, this is called triggerless DAQ (data acquisition). This entails noting down all datapoints you were ever able to measure. The data analysis method is actually too overpowered in this case, because the bulk of the junk data can be eliminated with something a lot simpler, like a relay logic. This is especially nice because we aren&#39;t wasting storage space on useless information. The relay logic or relay system can also be referred to as the umbrella term trigger logic (trigger system). This method, also known as synchronous DAQ is the main competitor of the triggerless DAQ.</p>
                    <p><img src="/DAQtypes.png" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto"></p>
                    <p>In the case of a synchronous DAQ, a trigger basically brushes through the signals like a haircomb: it organizes the signals into individual strands of hair (events), while brushing out all of the junk. Our data analysis software ROOT is built for handling data in events. 
                    <img src="/ROOT.png" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto"></p>
                    <p>On this picture, each branch is data, which we get from a detector or a single output of some detector. The entries in multiple branches were concurrent if they are in the same entry.</p>
                    <p>For example, a trigger system that I should&#39;ve used previously, but didn&#39;t, is recording  voltage signals only if they exceed some threshold voltage. How I did this was by requiring the Arduino to measure the voltage at every moment, but note it down only if it exceeds a threshold. This is not a trigger system, because the signal wasn&#39;t filtered BEFORE reaching the detector (Arduino&#39;s ADC). The trigger system that should&#39;ve been attached before the ADC is given on the following picture.
                    <img src="/easy_trigger.png" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto"></p>
                    <p>The discriminator works just like a comparator. It&#39;s output is used as a reference point for when to take measurements. Thanks to the delay component, the comparator&#39;s output transition (from &#39;high&#39; to &#39;low&#39; or vice versa) occurs precisely when the signal reaches the ADC. The second transition, which signifies the end of the measurement, occurs as the tail end of the signal passes the ADC.
                    <img src="/discriminator.png" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto"></p>
                    <p>Here you see the output of a dicriminator and its appearance on a NIM.</p>
                    <p>In synchronous DAQ, events are never perfectly synchronous. Delays from wires of different lengths can be on the order of 100ns. Additionally, the time difference caused by a particle hitting two detectors is 3.3ns per meter. In our 6m testing area, this results in a delay of up to 20ns between the detectors. Both factors cause signals to arrive at different times. This delay between the arrivals is the reason why coincidence modules have a regulatable signal width. </p>
                    <p>If we need to set three signals in coincidence, we should first set two of the signals in coincidence with each other and then set that signal into another coincidence with the 3rd signal. If we just set all of them into one big coincidence, then we could find that the some signal hasn&#39;t even arrived before another signal is already gone. This is because of the delays previously discussed, but also because the discriminator signals have an arbitrary (user-defined) length. It is easier for us to elongate the coincidence signal of inputs 1 &amp; 2, in a way that signal 3 would aso fit in the coincidence window, then it is to elongate 2 discriminator signals. 
                    <img src="/coincidence_better.png" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto"></p>
                    <p>Trigger systems can become very complicated, for example an extra layer of complexity is added if we take two previously explained trigger systems and combine the outputs of our two discriminators with an AND gate. This results in the coincidence method: if the voltage is above a treshold at both detectors simultaneously, then we know to take measurements. 
                    There is a short yet not infinitesimal time frame in which the signal needs to pass through the detector and other components until it gets stored on the disk. On the image, this time frame is 1ms. We cannot have a new trigger go off during that same time, since the processing of the previous one has still not yet finished, so we need to ignore all incoming signal for that time period. This is done by a busy logic.
                    <img src="/my_trigger.png" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto"></p>
                    <p>A busy logic is very intuitive: if your system says it&#39;s &#39;BUSY&#39;, then it&#39;s unaccepting of new signals because it has other stuff to do. It is ready to take on a new signal once it goes into &#39;NOT BUSY&#39; mode.

                    <p>Do signals usually come in bunches or are they more-or-less equally spaced? Well, as it turns out, there is a mathematical reason for them to come in bunches. For events that are both stochastic (random) and memoryless, the probability of an event happening is always highest at the current moment. <img src="/img/time_between.png" alt="image" width="100%" height="auto"></p>

                    <p>For more technical questions on the DWC, refer <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/702443/files/sl-note-98-023.pdf">here</a></p>
                    <p>DWCs a.k.a delay wire chambers are gas-filled rectangular chambers that help you track a particle - or at least get their position at the moment they pass the detector. They work like this: a particle passes the gas-filled (argon &amp; $CO_2$) chamber. If the particle is charged, it will ionize the gas inside. In the chamber there are multiple layers of parallel wires, each layer acting as an electrode with neighbouring layers being oppositely charged. 
                    The positive ions and electrons, which were created in the ionization, will start to move towards their respective electrodes (electrons towards anode and ions towards cathodes). They&#39;re not only moving towards the electrodes, they are also accelerating due to the Coulomb force – especially electrons, which reach such a high velocity, that they start to ionize the surrounding gas even further, creating an avalanche (more specifically a Townsend avalanche). Eventually all of the kicked out electrons reach the anode and cause a great current in it. This current in the anode (more specifically its magnetic field) will go on to create an image current* in the cathode. This step is important, because it&#39;s not the anode current that we are measuring, it&#39;s instead the image current in the cathode. Also, the current will be produced in 2-3 neighbouring cathode wires at a time.</p>
                    <h3 id="dwc-readout">DWC readout</h3>
                    <p>Neighbouring cathode wires are connected to each other with little delay lines. The two edgemost wires are connected to a sensor. The current from the edgemost wires has a characteristic shape: it&#39;s like a mountain composed of tiy steps. </p>
                    <p><details></p>
                    <p><summary>Image current*</summary>
                    <br>
                    ... also known as mirror current, in this context, is just the current which the magnetic field of the neighbouring anode produced in our cathode. The words &quot;image&quot; or &quot;mirror&quot; are used because it turns out that as far as the magnetic field is concerned, the current inside our electrode can be modelled as a reflection of the anode, where the mirror is the surface of our cathode.
                    </details>
                    Each tiny step is the contribution from a single wire. They add up consecutively thanks to the delay lines between the wires, but this is not really the important part. The delay lines are actually there so that the little current mountain would reach the two edges of the cathode, where the detectors are, at different times. The moment when the signal is detected in the sensor is at the rising edge. The detector is a TDC, time to digital converter. This is like a very precise stopwatch that measures the time from the trigger until a signal. The delay lines made it so that the time measured by the two TDCs is not equal. It&#39;s actually the difference in the times that gives us the position along one axis. 
                    $$ \text{time difference}=\text{time(Left)}-\text{time(Right)}$$
                    $$ X=A\cdot \left(\text{time difference}\right) + B $$
                    where the A and B are constants that were measured during the calibration. More specifically, A is the slope and B is the offset.</p>
                    <p>During calibration, a test generator is used to create electrical signals in the chamber. Though two signals are needed to find the two variables $A$ and $B$, it is standard practice to use three. Those three test point must lie on the same straight line. </p>
                    <h3 id="tdc-vs-scaler">TDC vs Scaler</h3>
                    <p>So a TDC is in essence just a stopwatch. And so is the scaler, but the scaler isn&#39;t controlled by the trigger, so this is one of the only detectors that is always just doing its own thing – measuring the time of every hit, no matter whether the TDAQ is <code>BUSY</code> or not. </p>

                    <p><img src="/xcet.gif" alt="Basic Cherenkov"></p>
                    <p>Cherenkov detectors, also known by the abbreviation XCET in our experiment, are gas-filled detectors designed to determinine if a charged particle passing through them exceeds a specific cutoff momentum. If the particle is faster than the phase velocity of light in that gas, the gas will emit light (the principle that nothing can be faster than light only applies to the group velocity of light, not the phase velocity).</p>
                    <p>The threshold momentum is regulated by the pressure in the detector. The higher the pressure, the higher is the refractive index and the slower does light travel in that medium. Hence, to raise the threshold momentum for particles, you need to decrease the pressure (so increase to decrease!).</p>
                    <p>By using two Cherenkov detectors at different pressures, with two distinct momentum cutoffs for light emission, you can identify all particles within the momentum range defined by the cutoff momenta of each detector. A particle will fall into this momentum range if it emits light in one Cherenkov detector but not in the other.</p>
                    <p>To map the momentum of all particles in the beam, i.e. to measure the particles&#39; spectrum, you need to perform a so-called pressure scan. For this, only one Cherenkov detector is necessary, but you need to vary the pressure in it from maximum to minimum. This can be done by initially pumping the detector full of gas and taking measurements while it gradually depressurizes.</p>
                    <p>The results of pressure scans are usually given by # of particles in a spill that made the medium emit light. You get an idea of what fraction of particles emitted light by comparing this to the trigger rate - the total number of particles in a spill. This is a sample pressure scan from our testbeam:
                    <img src="/che.png" alt="Pressure scan"></p>
                    <p>Here, the x-axis represents the pressure in the Cherenkov detector in bars. On the y-axis is the Cherenkov efficiency.
                    The efficiency of a Cherenkov detector is truly not an efficiency; it is actually the fraction of particles that emit light or</p>
                    <p>$\eta=\frac{\text{Light-emitting particles per spill}}{\text{Trigger rate}}$</p>
                    <p>As you can see from the previous picture, at low pressure the threshold momentum is very high, so there are few particles that actually get detected, but as the pressure increases, the momentum becomes less and less discriminating, so more particles are detected.</p>
                    <p>Pressure scans are more useful after you&#39;ve translated the x-axis from pressure to threshold momentum.Because particle energies usually follow a normal distribution, the 50% efficiency usually responds to the peak of the spectrum.

                    <p>CESAR is a software that deals with the beam configuration and also does measurements on a spill level. This means that it can identify the no. of particles in a spill that were counted by xyz detector but it cannot measure anything on a particle level. Hence, in CERN context this is not considered a DAQ (data acquisition system).
                    TDAQ is a trigger and data acquisition system. This one can do measurements on the particle level.
                    The no. of particles that you have in the beam is given by two numbers: the event and the trigger rate. Event rate is the one measured by CESAR and this can be taken as the de facto number of particles in a spill. Trigger rate, however, is the number you are actually able to measure with the TDAQ (readout takes some time).
                    <code>&amp;</code> means coincidence, for example <code>S0&amp;S1&amp;XCET040</code> is scintillators 0 and 1 set into coincidence with each other and the Cherenkov 40.

                    <p>QDC a.k.a a charge to digital converter allows you to measure the charge that passes through it. It comes in all shapes and sizes ranging from an electrical component to the impressive CAEN v792AC (see picture below) that we are using.</p>
                    <p><img src="/qdc1.jpeg" alt=""></p>
                    <p>Now let&#39;s look at the current at the QDC&#39;s input. </p>
                    <p><img src="/qdc2.png" alt=""></p>
                    <p>As you can see, there is a very strong background in addition to the current signal caused by a detector. For the noise to contribute as little as possible to our reading, and also to not lose any of the actual signal, we must pick a very specific integration window. On the picture you can see the thought process behind why the specific $t<em>{start}$ and $t</em>{end}$ were chosen. The same situation but in real life (and with voltage not current), on an oscilloscope...</p>
                    <p><img src="/qdc3.png" alt="">
                    The green signal here is known as a <code>GATE</code> signal. The gate carries the information about $t<em>{start}$ and $t</em>{end}$. When the gate goes <code>LOW</code>, our switch closes and current begins flowing onto one plate of the capacitor. To open the switch, the gate must become <code>HIGH</code> again. An uncharged capacitor initially acts as a wire, so a short-enough current signal that has just been let though the gate, will just go through the capacitor unbothered. Although it does not actually flow <em>through</em> it, instead the capacitor is being charged but the changing electric field creates a displacement current between the capacitor plates. Anyways, when the gate closes and the capacitor has just reached its maximum voltage, the ADC chimes in and measures the maximum voltage (and hence maximum charge on the capacitor) that was achieved during this cycle.</p>
                    <p><img src="/qdc4.png" alt="">
                    The inner workings of a QDC.</p>
                    <p>What opens and closes the gate? It&#39;s a so-called gate generator that receives the signal slightly earlier than the other components. This is because the other elements have a delay line attached to them, but the gate does not. When the gate generator detects a rise in current, it opens the gate just in time for the signal to arrive at the gate.</p>
                    <p>By the way, more often than not, the current entering a QDC is not only $I(t)$, our signal. There is also a pedestal current $I_{PED}$ – a constant current which is generated inside a QDC by default. Its purpose is to reduce the relative error on the ADC reading (I&#39;m not sure why this is important, since after subtracting the pedestal current in data analysis, the relative error will still be the same) and to bring the capacitor into a mode where it is working linearly, meaning the real capacitance coincides with the nominal one. The pedestal current also depends on the wires being used, so it must always be determined experimentally (and separately for every channel!). It is common practice to not deduct your pedestal current from the measurement results, but in an ideal world this deduction is always made.</p>

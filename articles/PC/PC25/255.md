In addition to the well-known conservation laws of energy and angular momentum, there is a third conserved quantity that is unique to central forces, where the force is proportional to $\\frac{1}{r^2}$—the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector:
$$\\mathbf{A}=\\mathbf{p}\\times \\mathbf{L}-mk\\hat{\\mathbf{r}},$$
where $k$ denotes the proportionality constant ($\\mathbf{F}=-\\frac{k}{r^2}\\mathbf{\\hat r}$). 

In classical mechanics, specifically, this vector is often called the eccentricity vector, since another representation of it is
$$
    \\mathbf{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}=\\frac{\\mathbf{p}\\times \\mathbf{L}}{mk}-\\mathbf{\\hat{r}},
    \\label{eq:1}
$$
which is, by magnitude, equal to the orbit's eccentricity.

This claim can be easily verified at the periapsis, where $\\mathbf{p}\\times \\mathbf{L}\\parallel \\mathbf{\\hat r}$. Let the distance to the central body be $r_{\\text{peri}}$, so that $$\\varepsilon=\\frac{m^2v^2r_{\\text{peri}}}{GMm^2}-1.$$ Substituting in $$v=\\sqrt{GM\\left(\\frac{2}{r}-\\frac{1}{a}\\right)}$$ which is the Vis-Viva equation, applicable at any point on a Keplerian orbit with semi-major axis $a$. Also, $r_{\\text{peri}}=a(1-e)$. Plugging these into Equation 1 yields $\\varepsilon=e$.

A graphical representation of Equation \\ref{eq:1} is given below. The blue arrows represent different $\\frac{\\mathbf{p}\\times \\mathbf{L}}{mk}$ vectors. The ends of the blue vector revolve around a unit circle, defined by the vector $\\mathbf{\\hat{r}}$.

Since $\\mathbf{p}\\perp \\mathbf{L}$, our velocity vectors can take the same configuration as the blue $\\mathbf{p}\\times \\mathbf{L}$ vectors in the figure above—they are simply rotated by $90^{\\circ}$ and rescaled by some constant (a less hand-wavy way to show this would be to take the dot product of $\\mathbf{\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}$ with itself).

Let us rescale the hodographs so that $1\\frac{km}{s}=1$. Eccentricity $e$ can be found as the ratio between the segment OC (previously $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$) and the radius of the circle (previously the unit vector $\\mathbf{\\hat{r}}$).

From the problem statement, we arrive at the following hodograph:

From applying the cosine theorem on $\\triangle XYZ$, 
$\\cos \\theta=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{65}} \\Rightarrow \\sin \\theta=\\frac{8}{\\sqrt{65}}.$
From triangle MCX, 
$R=\\frac{2}{\\sin \\theta}=\\frac{\\sqrt{65}}{4}.$ 
Also, from triangle MCX, 
$MC=R\\cos \\theta=\\frac{1}{4}.$ 
From triangle MOC, 
$OC=\\sqrt{MC^2+1^2}=\\frac{\\sqrt{17}}{4}.$ 
Lastly, 
$\\boxed{e=\\frac{OC}{R}=\\frac{\\sqrt{1105}}{65}.}$

I will also provide the result for a more general case where the magnitudes of $v_1, v_2$ and $v_3$ are unknown, but their directions are given. 

Knowing the directions, the velocity vectors must still fit inside a circle like this, as is customary for elliptic orbits.

The solution is exactly the same. From the cosine theorem, we find 

$$\\cos \\theta=\\frac{(v_1^2+v_2^2)+(v_3^2+v_2^2)-(v_1+v_3)^2}{2\\sqrt{v_1^2+v_2^2}\\sqrt{v_3^2+v_2^2}}=\\frac{v_2^2-v_1v_3}{\\sqrt{v_1^2+v_2^2}\\sqrt{v_3^2+v_2^2}}.$$

$$\\sin \\theta=\\frac{v_2(v_1+v_3)}{\\sqrt{v_1^2+v_2^2}\\sqrt{v_3^2+v_2^2}}, \\quad \\tan \\theta=\\frac{v_2(v_1+v_3)}{v_2^2-v_1v_3}, $$

$$MC=\\frac{MZ}{\\tan \\theta}=\\frac{v_2^2-v_1v_3}{2v_2}, \\qquad MO=\\frac{|v_1-v_3|}{2}$$

$$OC=\\sqrt{MC^2+MO^2}=\\frac{\\sqrt{v_2^2(v_1^2+v_2^2+v_3^2-4v_1v_3)+v_1^2v_3^2}}{2v_2}$$

$$R=\\frac{MZ}{\\sin \\theta}=\\frac{\\sqrt{v_1^2+v_2^2}\\sqrt{v_3^2+v_2^2}}{2v_2}$$

$R$ could have also been found (perhaps more simply) using Heron's formula.

$$e=\\frac{OC}{R}=\\frac{\\sqrt{v_2^2(v_1^2+v_2^2+v_3^2-4v_1v_3)+v_1^2v_3^2}}{\\sqrt{v_1^2+v_2^2}\\sqrt{v_3^2+v_2^2}}=\\boxed{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{4v_1v_2^2v_3}{(v_1^2+v_2^2)(v_2^2+v_3^2)}},}$$

which agrees nicely with our previous result.

Dobble & Maths
---

In a game of Dobble, there are no more than two common pictures on any two cards. There are 55 cards in a pack and 50 different pictures.
How many pictures are on one card?

We can find the number of picture pairs from two points of view:
First, we can combine 55 cards into $\\binom {55}2$ pairs.
At the same time, we can find this no. of pairs by the number of pictures both in total and on a single card. If there are maximally x pictures on a card, then the same picture will appear on $\\frac{55\\cdot x}{50}$ cards.
Hence, the number of pairs is also $$\\frac{\\frac{55x}{50}\\left(\\frac{55x}{50}-1\\right)}{2}.$$
$$55\cdot 54=\\frac{55x}{50}\\left(\\frac{55x}{50}-1\\right)$$
From which

Why these experiments are a massiva hassle, are because the detectors seem to have an inner life. One they, they work perfectly, but on the other, you can see them gradually fading away.

This is usually noticeable by the number of hits that the detector gets â€“ this number should always be lower than the trigger rate. Say the trigger gets 15,000 hits (i.e particles) per spill. Then, you'd expect a detector with 60% effiency to get around 9,000 hits per spill.

Whether this is really the case, is best analyzed through the scaler.

The red and green lines are the various tangents of the original circle. These pairs of lines used to be parallel (i.e. green1||green2 and red1||red2) because their points of tangency used to be diametically opposite of each other.

The intersection of red1 and red2, and green2 and green2, will form the focal plane, since parallell rays will converge on the focal plane.

The images of the diameters will also intersect the focal plane at special points: the angle between these points and the intersection of the red/green lines will subtend an angle of $90^\\circ$ w.r.t the centre of the lens, O.

Why? Well imagine that you were geometicaly constucting the refraction of two rays, that cross exactly on the lens. To construct the refracted rays, we will draw parallel lines to these rays, so that we will need to draw two rays emanating from O at an angle $90^\\circ$.

Knowing this criterion, we find that O can lie anywhere on the cicles shown above. But it needs to hold fo both green and red, hence O lies at the intersection of these circles. The lens itself is of course parallel to the focal plane.

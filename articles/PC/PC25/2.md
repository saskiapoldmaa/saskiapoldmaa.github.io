The animation above shows the motion of the four birds. 

From the animation, it is obvious that the birds will *not* stay in a tetrahedronal shape. Fortunately, there is a perspective from which the birds will stay in a consistent configuration.

When viewed from the axis, which connects the midpoints of $AC$ and $BD$, the birds are configured in a square. Also, the velocities of the four birds possess a rotational symmetry about this axis – thanks to this, the birds will always remain in a square configuration, as long as the viewer is located on this axis.

It might seem that this problem now simplifies into the well-known problem of three turtles on a plane. However, this is not the case as the birds are not located on the same plane – their velocity also has a component parallel to the axis.

Let us label the distance of bird A from the centroid along the axis as $h$. This distance is therefore $-h$ for bird B, $h$ for C and $-h$ for D. All birds are at the radius r from the axis and consecutive birds form an angle $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ with the axis.

Consecutive birds, say A and B, are separated by a distance $$| \\vec{AB}| =\\sqrt{2r^2+4h^2}$$ between them. The magnitude of bird A's velocity along the axis is $$\\frac{dh}{dt}=-\\frac{2h}{\\sqrt{2r^2+4h^2}}v$$ and it's radial velocity is  $$\\frac{dr}{dt}=-\\frac{r}{\\sqrt{2r^2+4h^2}}v.$$

Putting these expressions together, we get $$\\frac{dh}{dr}=\\frac{2h}{r} \\quad \\text{    or   } \\quad \\ln h = \\ln r + C.$$ Knowing that initially $r_0=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $h_0=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4}$, we get $$h=\\sqrt{2}r^2.$$

Knowing this is enough to find the distance which the bird flies before the collisions. In a square configuration, the radial velocity of any bird is always equal to its tangential velocity, that is why in a time interval $dt$ the bird will traverse a path $\\sqrt{2(dr)^2+(dh)^2}=\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{1+2r^2}\,dr$. Hence, the total traversed path is $$\\int_0^{1/2} \\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{1+4r^2}\,dr= \\frac{\\text{arcsinh}(1)+\\sqrt{2}}{2^{\\frac{3}{2}}}\\approx 0.812$$

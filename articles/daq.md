Data Acquisition systems, or DAQs, are the heart of modern experimental setups. They gather, process, and store data from detectors, allowing researchers to analyze experimental results in real time or offline.

A typical DAQ system includes components like digitizers, triggers, and data storage units. The digitizer converts analog signals from detectors into digital data that can be processed by computers.

The image above illustrates the flow of data within a DAQ system. Detectors produce signals that are digitized, filtered, and stored for analysis. Timing synchronization is critical, and DAQ systems often include precise clocks to ensure accurate event reconstruction.

Modern DAQ systems use software frameworks to manage data flow and enable user-friendly configuration. For example, the CAEN SY5527 system allows seamless integration with custom analysis software, as shown above.

Whether in high-energy physics or medical imaging, DAQs play an essential role in extracting meaningful information from complex experiments.
